# Biker-s-Portal
A Django webapp to consolidate multiple utilities for riders.
This app is a course project extention and contains the following utilities:
1) A turn-by-turn navigation system using Google Maps API
2) A route and destination weather checker using Accuweather API
3) A web crawler based product catalogue for all riding related articles

I'm open to suggestions and improvements if you have any for me.

p.s. the full framework code may not be present here, but it should work on any Django app by putting in your API keys and code in "src" folder.
